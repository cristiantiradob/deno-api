# Deno API Boilerplate

This Deno API Boilerplate is crafted to provide a robust starting point for building scalable and maintainable Deno applications using the MVC architecture and Object-Oriented principles.

## Features

- MVC Architecture: Organized file structure for Models, Views, and Controllers.
- Object-Oriented: Leveraging TypeScript for class-based organization.
- Linting: Pre-configured to ensure code quality.
- Formatting: Automated formatting for consistent code style.

## Development

To start the development server, run the following task:

```sh
deno task dev
```

This command runs the server in development mode, with live reloading on file changes.

## Linting and Formatting

Use the following commands to lint and format your code:

```sh
deno lint
deno fmt
```
